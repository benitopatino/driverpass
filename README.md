#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
 -   The DriverPass project provides users to take exams, enroll in courses, and set up driving training appointments

#### What did you do particularly well?
 - I believe I described the business requirements very well. Also, the diagrams I created described the systems functionality and different entities.
 
#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 - I would love to re-work the System Design Document. I did not complete the technical requirements portion of the document.
 
#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
 - I took the users requirements and broke them down into different use cases and models. Ensuring the user's needs are met is crucial for creating a system that will solve their problems. 
 
#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
 - A step by step approach is always my plan. Following the software development life cycle provides a guideline for planning, designing, and implementing a system.
